# Rename a device [eth0] with a new name [wan]

# Always prefer renaming through MACAddress resolution instead of assigned network name
#     Network name might change and it's subject to change from kernel or systemd, 
#     while mac address is absolutely tied to a specific device only
OriginalName=eth0
