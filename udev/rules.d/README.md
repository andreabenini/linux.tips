# Generic rules.d tips
## Cheap devices without serial numbers
When you deal with ultra cheap chinese made usb devices without a serial number you usually run into troubles with udev and usual **rules.d** won't apply to these devices.
Moreover, device name is usually determined by: device boot detection, devices insertion order.  
Even more: it's rather easy to get lost when more than one device of the same type is connected to your computer.  
One easy trick to get things sorted might be to link the discovered device to a defined name. Using the usb port name as a detection point is nice because you might associate to the device by your familiar name and let the udev autonum do its own usual things.  
This example is related to an ultra cheap Prolific compatible PL2303 USB-TTL converter, `KERNELS` is defined as the USB port where it's connected, this is the `rules.d file`:
```txt
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", DRIVERS=="pl2303", KERNELS=="3-1:1.0", SYMLINK+="usb-esp"
```
Create a file with a suitable name in `/etc/udev/rules.d`, permissions and chown as usual. `KERNELS` value might be obtained from:
```sh
udevadm info -a -n /dev/ttyUSB1
# Where /dev/ttyUSB1 is the autogenerated name of the device
# Search in the KERNELS strings and it's usually something like: "N-N:N-N"
```
Then trigger udev to reload your changes, there's no need to restart the service or reboot.  
```sh
udevadm trigger
```
and now you can see the new name, it doesn't really matters if you reconnect or the original name changes, whenever you have it connected in that specific USB port you'll always see something like:
```sh
ls -la /dev/usb-esp 
# lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Mar 23 17:17 /dev/usb-esp -> ttyUSB1
# ttyUSB1 might change but you don't really care because you can always refer to /dev/usb-esp
```
